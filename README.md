# Hi, i'm Alex ðŸ‘‹
I have extensive experience in marketing and business development. I started as an ordinary clerk and worked my way up to become the director of development and marketing for a large international investment holding company. During this time, I was responsible for creating a highly profitable business with a vertically integrated management structure.

However, that was in a previous role. Currently, I am focused on learning new skills related to internet business, online presence, analytics, and programming. I am also learning query languages and analytical functions.
