# Hi, i'm Alex 👋
I have extensive experience in marketing and business development. I started as an ordinary clerk and worked my way up to become the director of development and marketing for a large international investment holding company. During this time, I was responsible for creating a highly profitable business with a vertically integrated management structure.

However, that was in a previous role. Currently, I am focused on learning new skills related to internet business, online presence, analytics, and programming. I am also learning query languages and analytical functions.

### Education:
*   [2000] Director, Sound engineer in [Russian Academy of Theatre Arts (РАТИ-ГИТИС)](https://gitis.net/en/)
*   [2004] International business, Economist in [Russian State University for the Humanities (РГГУ)](https://www.rsuh.ru/en/)
*   [2023] Manager of Marketplaces in [Yandex](https://practicum.yandex.ru/)
*   [2024] Data Analyst in [Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation](https://en.fa.ru/)
*   🌱 [now] Python Developer in [ProductStar by RBC (РБК-ПродуктСтар)](https://productstar.ru/)
